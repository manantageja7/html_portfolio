<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Manan Tageja, a passionate and dedicated B.Tech Computer Science student at VIT Bhopal University. I thrive on solving real-world problems through technology and collaboration. My interests lie in software development, data visualization, and creative projects that merge logic with innovation.</p>

<p>I've worked on diverse projects, including Campus Connect, a Python-based platform that provides essential information about Indian universities, and a dynamic visualization of Kepler's Laws, exploring the physics of planetary motion with varying star and planet masses. These experiences have deepened my skills in Python, teamwork, and presenting technical content effectively.</p>

<p>I approach challenges with curiosity, break down complex ideas with analytical thinking, and value clarity in both code and communication. I'm always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to impactful tech solutions.</p>
